# part 1: basic function calls
def greet():
    print("hello")
    print("how do you do?")

greet() # the above greet function is going to get called here on line 5. this is essentially the 'first' line of the code
        # if we don't have greet(), we won't be able to call what's defined in the greet function, which in this case, is 2 print statements
