# using the length function within a function

marks = [55, 64, 75, 80, 34]

length = len(marks)
print("Length is", length) 

#Line 6 is the first line of the code
#it takes the string 'length is' and then calls the function called length
#within length on line 5, it is asking for the length (number of items) in the function marks
# on line 3, marks has 5 items - the length is therefore 5
# so now, on line 6, it will print "Length is 5"
